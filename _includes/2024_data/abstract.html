            <p> In recent years, there has been an emergence in high-performance workflow systems to address large-scale, complex scientific applications involving the interoperation of heterogeneous parallel tasks, massive data storage, and computational resources.  From scientific workflows coupling HPC simulations to distributed data-driven analytics frameworks to many task ensemble applications, workflow execution environments place significant demands on the system platform for its scalable and efficient operation.  In contrast to the performance optimization of traditional HPC applications that can rely on post-mortem performance analysis, dynamic performance monitoring and in situ analysis are crucial for evaluating and guiding resource management strategies for modern workflows.  The workshop will focus on research topics related to deploying high-performance workflow systems and integrating state-of-the-art technologies in this field. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, performance modeling, resource management, fault tolerance, programming models, observability, and other aspects of workflow systems coupling in-situ/near-real-time analytics with HPC simulations/experiments. </p>

            <p> The workshop is relevant to multiple aspects of parallel processing – HPC, workflows, runtime systems, performance measurement and analysis, scalability, and scheduling – that come together in high-performance workflow-driven applications where dynamic behavior and performance variability present challenges to effective workflow execution, resource scheduling, and tuning.  The target audience would encompass researchers and practitioners across the parallel processing spectrum, from HPC experts and workflow system developers to runtime system engineers, performance analysts, and scalability specialists. </p>

            <p> The main goals of the workshop are to bring together researchers across these aspects to discuss challenges facing the development of observability, online monitoring, and in situ analytics capabilities for scalable workflow operation and optimization. </p>

            <p>Topics of interest include but are not limited to:</p>
